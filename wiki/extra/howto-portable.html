title: How to make a portable installation
---
<p><em>Only for Windows</em></p>
<p>Portable means that you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have an installation on an external medium (USB-harddisk)</li>
    <li>You can plug in to any PC as is.</li>
    <li>You don't need to install anything on the PC</li>
    <li>You don't need to change the setup</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a folder for SABnzbd to put its data</li>
    <li>Make sure that all directories are relative paths starting from the directory where the INI file is</li>
    <li>Tell SABnzbd where the INI file is, using the -f parameter</li>
    <li>Use 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 as the web server address</li>
    <li>Choose a port number that is free on all systems (8080 or 8088 is good choice)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:<br>
    The easiest way is to use the "portable.cmd" script<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>portable.cmd -s 127.0.0.1:8080</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
You replace 8080 with a correct port number for the particular PC.<br>
The -s parameter is just a one time requirement.
<p>You may encounter software firewalls which you will have to teach about SABnzbd.<br>
    SABnzbd has two types of Internet access: port 119 or 443 for communicating with the Usenet server and port 8080 (or whatever else you choose) to communicate with the web browser.
</p>
<p>Choose the "Default" user interface, since only that one is compatible with all web browsers.</p>
