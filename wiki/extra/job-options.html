<p>For each download job you can set post-processing options. While the download is still in the queue, you can even change them on-the-fly.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Download</td>
            <td>No post processing at all. Just download all the files (including PAR2). The user has to do any post-processing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+Repair</td>
            <td>Download files and do a PAR2 verification. If the verification fails, download more PAR2 files and attempt to repair the files.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+Unpack</td>
            <td>Download in <strong><em>repair</em></strong> mode and unpack any RAR and ZIP files.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+Delete</td>
            <td>Download in <em><strong>unpack</strong></em> mode and delete the RAR and ZIP files that were unpacked</td>
        </tr>
