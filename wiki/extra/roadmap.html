title: Roadmap

<p>This is a limited overview of features that will be developed for future versions.<br>
    The team has committed to these features, but we cannot give a time frame for all subjects.
</p>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>AutoSplit</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes people have an NZB containing a whole season of shows and then miss the Sort capabilities.<br>
    The (optional) AutoSplit will split such an NZB into separate jobs.<br>
    This has two advantages: the first episode is completed sooner and the episodes are individually treated by Sort.
</p>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Detecting season/episode material is based on the naming of the sub-posts, so activation of Sort depends on these names and not on the NZB name as is normally the case.</li>
    <li>When multiple episodes share a single set of par2 files, AutoSplit will not activate.</li>
</ul>
