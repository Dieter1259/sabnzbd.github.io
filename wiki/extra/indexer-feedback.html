title: Indexer feedback
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SABnzbd has automatic feedback for indexers integrated since <strong>before version 0.7</strong>. It was originally made for OZnzb and thus had these labels within SABnzbd. However, it has always supported other indexers and since SABnzbd 1.1.0 the references to OZnzb have been removed.

<p>SABnzbd can automatically report if a download was encrypted or failed and for which servers it failed, without user input. The user can also see in the Queue the rating for audio and video given by other users while it's downloading.

<p>The user can submit from the SABnzbd history with 2 clicks feedback about:
<ul>
    <li>Thumbs up/down (+1/-1)</li>
    <li>Video/audio rating</li>
    <li>Passworded</li>
    <li>Spam</li>
    <li>Other problem</li>
    <li>Leave comment</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable ratings, the user needs to enable the Indexer integration in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches#toc6">Switches</a>. 
<br><span class="label label-primary">IMPORTANT</span> The indexer can provide an URL including the API-key for the user, <strong>OR</strong> the user can set a <code>rating_host</code> and <code>rating_api_key</code> in the settings.

<p>When a job from the specified indexer is added, SABnzbd will use the ratings supplied by the indexer. The user can set in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches#toc6">Switches</a> if it wants to abort or pause a job based on those ratings or status codes.

<h2>Supplying data to SABnzbd</h2>

<p><strong>The integration is working when you see the video and audio rating icons in the queue, even if no rating by other users was given.</strong>

<h3>Using <code>meta</code> tags</h3>
<p>For it to work, the indexer needs to specify a <code>meta</code> tag in the NZB file (see <a href="/wiki/extra/nzb-spec">NZB Format Specification</a>) that indicates the link to the ID of the job in the indexer database:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<meta type="x-rating-id">ID-OF-JOB-AT-INDEXER</meta>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Optionally the statistics should be included, so SABnzbd can do filtering based on them and the user can see them in the queue. 
<p>These are the fields that are available:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<meta type="x-rating-video">VIDEO-SCORE</meta> <!-- From 1-10 -->
<meta type="x-rating-videocnt">NUMBER-OF-VOTES</meta>
<meta type="x-rating-audio">AUDIO-SCORE</meta>
<meta type="x-rating-audiocnt">NUMBER-OF-VOTES</meta>
<meta type="x-rating-voteup">NUMBER-OF-UPVOTES</meta>
<meta type="x-rating-votedown">NUMBER-OF-DOWNVOTES</meta>
<meta type="x-rating-spam">NUMBER-OF-TIMES-REPORTED-AS-SPAM</meta> 
<meta type="x-rating-confirmed-spam">yes/no</meta>  <!-- Confirmed by admins/mods -->
<meta type="x-rating-passworded">NUMBER-OF-TIMES-REPORTED-AS-PASSWORDED</meta> 
<meta type="x-rating-confirmed-passworded">yes/no</meta>  <!-- Confirmed by admins/mods -->
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In order to override the user's settings, the following (optional) fields can be supplied. If they are not supplied, the information from the user's setting is used:

{% highlight xml %}
<meta type="x-rating-host">indexer.com</meta>
 <!-- OR -->
<meta type="x-rating-url">https://indexer.com/api?mode=feedback&apikey=KEY</meta>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Using headers</h3>
<p>Alternatively, the same fields can be supplied when the NZB is fetched using HTTP headers. However, data will be transient and not available when the NZB is added again by the user.

{% highlight header %}
x-rating-id: ID-OF-JOB-AT-INDEXER
x-rating-video: VIDEO-SCORE
x-rating-videocnt: NUMBER-OF-VOTES
x-rating-audio: AUDIO-SCORE
x-rating-audiocnt: NUMBER-OF-VOTES
x-rating-voteup: NUMBER-OF-UPVOTES
x-rating-votedown: NUMBER-OF-DOWNVOTES
x-rating-spam: NUMBER-OF-TIMES-REPORTED-AS-SPAM
x-rating-confirmed-spam: yes/no 
x-rating-passworded: NUMBER-OF-TIMES-REPORTED-AS-PASSWORDED
x-rating-confirmed-passworded: yes/no

x-rating-host: indexer.com
OR
x-rating-url: https://indexer.com/api?mode=feedback&apikey=KEY
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Reporting by SABnzbd</h2>
<p>The endpoint that SABnzbd will do a <code>POST</code> request to when no override is supllied will be: <code>https://RATING_HOST/releaseRatings/releaseRatings.php</code>
<p><strong>OR</strong> it will be send to the beforementioned <code>x-rating-url</code>. 

<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> The <code>RATING_HOST</code> set by the user or supplied via <code>x-rating-url</code>/<code>x-rating-host</code> needs to support HTTPS, data will not be send over HTTP.

<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Reports can be send by the user manually (<code>auto=0</code>) or automatically (<code>auto=1</code>) if a job was encrypted or if it failed because it was missing from the servers. The automatic reports will be send when the job is done post-processing</p>



<p><span class="label label-danger">NOTE</span> Omitted <code>apikey</code> (if filled by user in config) and <code>i</code> after the first example, but they will be send with every request
