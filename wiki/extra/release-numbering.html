title: Release Numbering

<p>We use a three group release number.</p>
<p>Major.minor.bugfix</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Major</td>
            <td>A major breaking release. May not be compatible with your current release and may require things like rebuilding your queue. Going back to a previous release is not straightforward.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Minor</td>
            <td>We added new features. The upgrade will try to preserve your current queue. You may need to review your configuration. Going back should be no problem.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bugfix</td>
            <td>We fixed some bugs. Upgrade is trivial. So is going back to an older release (should we have fixed bugs incorrectly or inadvertently added new bugs.</td>
