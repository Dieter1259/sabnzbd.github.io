title: Install As A Unix Daemon
---
<p>Running SABnzbd directly from a shell or a desktop shortcut is not always practical, especially not on a server.<br>
    It is important that SABnzbd is closed properly when a system goes down, otherwise data will be lost.
</p>
<p>Below is an example start/stop script that can also be called from <em>init.d</em> scripts.<br>
    You need to replace <em>sabuser</em> with the proper user account and <em>HOSTADDRESS:PORT</em> by the proper address and port.<br>
    This assumes that you have installed SABnzbd in folder /usr/local/src/SABnzbd.
</p>
<div class="code">
        <pre><code>#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
start)
  echo "Starting SABnzbd."
  /usr/bin/sudo -u sabuser -H /usr/local/src/SABnzbd/SABnzbd.py -d -f /home/sabuser/.sabnzbd/sabnzbd.ini
;;
stop)
  echo "Shutting down SABnzbd."
  /usr/bin/wget -q --delete-after "http://HOSTADDRESS:PORT/sabnzbd/api?mode=shutdown&amp;apikey=ENTERAPIKEYHERE"
;;
*)
  echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
  exit 1
esac

exit 0</code>
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>If you use a password to secure SABnzbd, modify the shutdown url to the following:</p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre><code>http://HOSTADDRESS:PORT/sabnzbd/api?mode=shutdown&amp;ma_username=USER&amp;ma_password=PASSWORD&amp;apikey=ENTERAPIKEYHER</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Note: This may not be applicable for your distribution! Debian and Ubuntu have their own init script, see the <a href="/wiki/installation/install-ubuntu-repo">Ubuntu Install Docs</a>.</p>
