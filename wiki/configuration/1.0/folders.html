    <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2">2. The Watched Folder supports <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/categories">user-defined categories</a> in two ways: <strong>Categories</strong>: Create a folder inside your watched folder with the same name as one of your categories. Placing a file inside that folder will add the category with the same name as the sub-folder when it is imported. Example: If you have a category called "Random", place a file inside C:\WatchedFolder\Random and it will be picked up and assigned to the "Random" category (if it exists). <strong>Filename Prefix</strong>: If an NZB file has a prefix, for example <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"{{movies}}My favorite movie.nzb"</span>, it will be handled as the file "My favorite movie.nzb", having category "movies".</div>
