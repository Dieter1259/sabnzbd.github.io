title: Configure
---
<p>SABnzbd comes with sensible defaults to work, however there are plenty of options and tweaks that may be done to get the most out of what sab can do.<br>
    View the relevant page for more information on what an option does and more.
</p>
<p>All configuration data is stored in the so-called INI file. Which INI file used, you can see on the Configuration main page.<br>
    The default location is:

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Windows XP/2003</td>
            <td>C:\Documents and Settings\<strong>user</strong>\Local Data\Application Data\sabnzbd\sabnzbd.ini</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 10</td>

<hr>
<p>Sab relies on using existing utilities to extract, repair, and process files once they have been downloaded.<br>
    Some of these utilities are provided with sab while some require the user to install, also some may only be optional depending on how you use sab.

<h2 id="toc1"><span>SSL</span></h2>
<p>In order to connect to your newsserver using SSL you need to install pyOpenSSL and OpenSSL (sometimes provided in 1 package). Installation depends on your platform.<br>
    Windows and OSX packages already include the required files and should work after installation of SABnzbd.<br>
    Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-openssl<br>
    Running from source: pip install pyopenssl

<h2 id="toc2"><span>yEnc</span></h2>
<p>Posts on usernet are coded in the yEnc format, decoding this during the downloading using Python is not very efficient. Therefore we implemented this part in C for a big gain in performance.<br>
    For your system you might need to compile this module separately.
