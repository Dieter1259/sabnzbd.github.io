<h2 id="toc0"><span>Web server</span></h2>
The user interface of SABnzb is a web-site. You can modify some web site behaviour here.<br>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Host</strong></td>
            <td>The hostname that will be used to access sabnzbd. The default of localhost will only allow access from the computer running sabnzbd. Change to 0.0.0.0 (unless using vista) or leave it empty (auto-finds local ip address) to be able to access from other pcs in your network. For more information see <a href="/wiki/advanced/command-line-parameters">command-line-parameters</a>.<br>
                <br>
                127.0.0.1 or [::1] or localhost = Access from this computer only<br>
                empty = Finds and listens on your local (ipv4) ip address. Used for accessing from other computers. localhost will not work anymore so update your bookmarks.<br>
                0.0.0.0 = Listens on multiple interfaces (both local IP and localhost). Recommended if you are not running vista. Vista prefers ipv6 so your ipv4 ip address (192.168.x.x) won't work which means forwarding the ports may not work. Note for Ubuntu users on Karmic (9.10): if 0.0.0.0 doesn't seem to work for you, try the actual internal or external IP you want to use.<br>
                :: = Listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for local and network access.
