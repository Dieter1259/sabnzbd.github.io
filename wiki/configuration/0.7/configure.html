<p>SABnzbd has lots of configuration options. Most have a sensible default and need no changing unless you have special needs.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/servers">Server</a> section you have to fill in, otherwise SABnzbd will not know were to download from.<br>
    Also have a look at where the <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/folders">download directory</a> is located and you may want to checkout the <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/notifications">Email</a> part.

<p>All configuration data is stored in the so-called INI file. Which INI file used, you can see on the Configuration main page.<br>
    The default location is:
