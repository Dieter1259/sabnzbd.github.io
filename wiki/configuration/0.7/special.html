title: Special settings

<p>There are some special settings that have no fancy Web user interface.<br>
    The explanation of each is here.

            <td>Older versions of SABnzbd had the possibility to move downloads to folders named after the actual Usenet group. This option is made more or less obsolete by the category system. If you still want the old behaviour, remove all categories and set this option to 1</td>

However, it seems that there are some security tools that try to access anything that looks like a webserver. If you cannot disable the cause of the warnings, you can choose to disable the warning.</td>

Jobs will not be post-processed, but remain in the temporary download folder and finally end up in History as "failed". From there you can either post-process the job after all or just delete everything.</td>

Set this option to limit each element of the total path. Each element will be truncated to the specified number. 64 is a safe value. The option will also work for other operating systems.</td>

It can happen that such a drive isn't mounted yet when SABnzbd starts up, causing it to create a new folder at the default location. To prevent this, set the option to 1. This will make SABnzbd wait until the drive is available. Note that SABnzbd will hang until the drive is available! Also, the folder must already exist otherwise SABnzbd will hang until terminated.
