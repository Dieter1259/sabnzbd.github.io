<h2 id="toc0"><span>Configure Scheduling</span></h2>
<p>You may want to restrict downloading to specific time slots. This can be because your ISP or Usenet provider wants you to.<br>
    Or maybe you don't want to download during peak usage of your family.<br>
    SABnzbd allows you to specify moments to switch between PAUSE and RESUME mode, set a speedlimit or shutdown SABnzbd.<br>
    Each schedule block is repeated one per week or every day.<br>
    The four parameters of a schedule block are, from left to right:

<h4 id="toc1"><span>Note</span></h4>
<p>On startup, SABnzbd will evaluate all schedules and determine the current pause/resume state and speedlimit.<br>
    The â€”pause <a href="/wiki/advanced/command-line-parameters">command-line parameter</a> will override this evaluation.<br>
    Also on each schedule change, the schedule will be re-evaluated and the speedlimit will be set. If SABnzbd happened to be paused, it will NOT be resumed by the schedule evaluation. This is to prevent spontaneous resumption during schedule changes.
</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Example</span></h2>
<p>Suppose you only want to download on weekdays between 1:00AM and 5:30PM and in the weekend between 1:00 AM and 11:00AM.<br>
    You set this up using four schedule blocks.
</p>
<p>Resume downloading every day at 1:00AM:<br>
    01:00 Daily Resume
</p>
<p>Pause downloading every day at 5:30PM (= 17:30 military time):<br>
    17:30 Daily Pause
</p>
<p>Pause downloading on Saturday 11:00AM:<br>
    11:00 Saturday Pause
</p>
<p>Pause downloading on Sunday 11:00AM:<br>
    11:00 Sunday Pause
</p>
<p>Enable server on Monday 6:00AM:<br>
