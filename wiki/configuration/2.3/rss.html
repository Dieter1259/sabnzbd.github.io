<p>
    SABnzbd can read RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites.
    These sites will offer you the latest downloads or return results based on some query. For a list of supported RSS sites <a href="/wiki/introduction/nzb-sources">see here.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Each feed is analyzed using filters.
    A filter looks for text pattern in the title of the entries and based on that rejects or accepts a job.
    A filter "matches" if the text it contains is found inside a title.
    You can add <code>*</code> to match arbitrary parts of the title or <code>?</code> for 1 arbitrary character at that place.
    The filters are analyzed in order and the first matching one will be selected.

<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
    Suppose you subscribe to a feed and the output of titles in this feed is:
</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 2
My first teen steps hdtv xvid Part 1
My first baby steps xvid Part 1
My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 2
The making of My first baby steps xvid hdtv</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now suppose you want to get all <code>My ... first steps</code> episodes, but only when marked <code>hdtv</code> and your not interested in <code>Making of</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Reject || making of
Accept || first*steps*hdtv</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>Reject</code> filter should come first, otherwise the <code>Accept</code> filter will also pick the <code>Making of</code>.</p>

<p>
    It's also possible to setup a <code>Required</code> filter.
    This means that the following filters are only applied when a title matches the <code>Required</code> filter.<br>
    Suppose you are only interested in <code>hdtv</code> format, you setup this:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Requires || hdtv
Accept || first*steps
Accept || second*steps</code>
</pre>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>
    For each feed you can set the category or the <a href="/wiki/extra/job-options">job options</a> for all jobs in the feed in the top row, or for each <code>Accept</code> filter specifically.<br>
    If all category settings are left to <code>Default</code> and the indexer category matches one of your categories (by category name or by <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">custom <code>Indexer tag</code></a>), it will be automatically assigned to that category. <br>
    The assigned or automatically matched category is shown in the Category column.

<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>
    If you prefix a filter with <code>re:</code> it will be interpreted as a Python regular expression (case-insensitive).<br>
    Here's a <a href="http://www.developer.com/lang/article.php/3330231" target="_blank">tutorial on regular expressions</a>.
    For all the details see <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html" target="_blank">the Python manual</a>.
</p>
<p>Simple example: <code>re: this|that</code> will match all jobs containing <code>this</code> or <code>that</code> in the title.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Automatic processing</h2>
<p>
    If you check the checkbox next to the name of the feed, it will be automatically processed.<br>
    The time between scans can be set with <code>RSS checking rate</code>.<br>
    You can also override this by using the Scheduler, in this case the  <code>RSS checking rate</code> will be ignored.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>First batch</h2>
<p>
    To prevent the download of a (potentially) large backlog, the first batch of NZBs will not be downloaded automatically. These lines are marked with an asterisk <code>*</code>. Only new jobs in subsequent read-outs will be downloaded automatically (if the feed is enabled).<br>
    If you still want the matches in the first batch to be downloaded, click on the <code>Force Download</code> button.
