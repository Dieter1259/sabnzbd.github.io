title: RSS

<p>SABnzbd can read RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites.<br>
    These sites will offer you the latest downloads or return results based on some query.
</p>
<p>For a list of supported RSS sites <a href="/wiki/introduction/nzb-sources">see here.</a><br>
    <em>Please note: some website feeds require the inclusion of authentication details in the URL. Please see the sites for details on connecting to your particular feed provider.</em>
</p>
<p>Each feed is analysed using filters.<br>
    A filter looks for text pattern in the title of the entries.<br>
    A filter "matches" if the text it contains is found inside a title.<br>
    You can add '*' characters that will match arbitrary parts of the title.<br>
    There are accept and reject filters.<br>
    The filters are analysed in order and the first matching one will be selected.
</p>
<p>An example will make things clear.<br>
    Suppose you subscribe to the feed <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><a class="vglnk" href="http://www.tvnzb.com/tvnzb_new.rss" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>www</span><span>.</span><span>tvnzb</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>tvnzb</span><span>_</span><span>new</span><span>.</span><span>rss</span></a></span>.<br>
    The output of titles in this feed could be:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 2
My first teen steps hdtv xvid Part 1
My first baby steps xvid Part 1
My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 2
The making of My first baby steps xvid hdtv</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now suppose you want to get all "My â€¦ first steps" episodes, but only when marked hdtv.<br>
    And your not interested in "Making of".<br>
    So, you set up these filters:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Accept || first*steps*hdtv</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
The Reject filter should come first, otherwise the Accept filter will also pick the "Making of".
<p>For each feed you can set a default <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.2/categories">category</a> or (when no categories are set up) the <a href="/wiki/extra/job-options">job-options</a>.<br>
    Also, for each filter you override the defaults (also for Reject filter, but this has no use).
</p>
<p>It's also possible to setup a "Required" filter.<br>
    This means that the following filters are only applied when a title matches the "Required" filtrer.<br>
    Suppose you are only interested in the "hdtv" format, you setup this:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Requires || hdtv
Accept || first*steps
Accept || second*steps</code>
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Filters</span></h3>
These are all the provided filters.<br>
Please note that "From SxxEyy" will only work when SABnzbd recognizes the season/episode notation in the job title.<br>
Note also that "RequireCat" only works for indexers that provide categories and whose categories have been mapped to your own (See <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.2/categories">Config-&gt;Categories</a>)<br>

<h3 id="toc2"><span>Regular expressions</span></h3>
<p>If you prefix a filter with 're:' it will be interpreted as a Python regular expression.<br>
    Here's a <a href="http://www.developer.com/lang/article.php/3330231" target="_blank">tutorial on regular expressions</a>.<br>
    For all the details see <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html" target="_blank">the Python manual</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Automatic processing</span></h3>
<p>If you check the checkbox next to the name of the feed, it will be automatically processed.<br>
    The time between scans can be set in <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.2/general">Config-&gt;General</a>, item "RSS checking rate".<br>
    Note: you do not need to setup anything in the Scheduler.
</p>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>First batch</span></h3>
<p>Note: to prevent the download of a (potentially) large backlog, the first batch of NZBs will not be downloaded automatically. These lines are marked with an asterisk '*'. Only new jobs in subsequent read-outs will be downloaded.<br>
    If you still want the matches in the first batch to be downloaded, click on the "Force Download" button.
