title: Servers
---
<p>If you want to download anything, you need to have access to one or more Usenet servers.
    These servers can be your own ISP's Usenet server, a free public one or one of the many commercial servers.
    For each server you need to specify its parameters.
</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Priorities</span></h2>
<p>You assign each server a priority, a number between <code>0</code> (highest) and <code>99</code> (lowest).<br>
    SABnzbd will first try to get articles from the group of servers with the highest priority.
    Within the priority group, the first server with a free connection will be tried.
    When the first tried server doesn't have an article, then another server with the same priority is tried.<br>
    When none of the primary servers has a specific article, a lower priority group is tried. Within the lower priority group, the same method is used: the first server with a free slot is tried.
</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: Check your Usenet provider's documentation for the proper values!</p>

    <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1">1. Retention means the number of days that articles are kept by the server, after this number of days, the server will start removing articles. Note that retention is an average number. In reality the server will start removing articles when its storage becomes too full.</div>
    <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2">2. When you declare a server with a long retention time as optional and the server is temporary out-of-service, SABnzbd will fall back to another server. If the alternative server has a shorter retention time, you will miss articles if the articles are beyond the retention time of the alternative server. It is best to set your most reliable and longest retention time server as a lower priority server but not as optional. Secondary servers (cheaper, less reliable, shorter retention time) can be set as <em>high priority</em> and <em>optional</em>.</div>
