<p>SABnzbd comes with sensible defaults to work, however, there are plenty of options and tweaks to tailor SABnzbd to your needs.<br>
    View the relevant page for more information on what an option does and more.
</p>
<p>All configuration data is stored in the so-called INI file. Which INI file used, you can see on the Configuration main page. <br>
Default locations for each operating system can be found in <a href="/wiki/advanced/directory-setup">Folder Setup</a>.

<p>SABnzbd relies on using existing utilities to extract, repair, and process files once they have been downloaded.<br>
    Some of these utilities are provided with SABnzbd while some require the user to install, also some may only be optional depending on how you use SABnzbd.

<h2 id="no_ssl"><span>SSL not available</span></h2>
<p>In order to connect to your newsserver using SSL you need to install pyOpenSSL and OpenSSL (sometimes provided in 1 package). Installation depends on your platform. Windows and macOS packages already include the required files and should work after installation of SABnzbd.</p>
<p>Ubuntu: <br>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-openssl</code></pre>
 <p>Running from source: <br>
    <pre><code>pip install pyopenssl</code></pre>
</p>

<h2 id="no_yenc"><span>yEnc not available</span></h2>
<p>Posts on usernet are coded in the yEnc format, decoding this during the downloading using Python is not very efficient. Therefore we implemented this part in C for a big gain in performance. 
<p>Installing yEnc can only be done when you have a C-compiler installed. This is usually the case on Unix systems, for <a href="/wiki/installation/install-from-source-windows">Windows</a> and <a href="/wiki/installation/install-osx-src">Apple macOS</a> see the specifc guides how to install yEnc.<br>
With a compiler and <code>pip</code> installed, you can simply run this command:
<pre><code>pip install http://www.golug.it/pub/yenc/yenc-0.4.0.tar.gz</pre></code>
