<h2 id="toc7"><span>Multi-core PAR2</span></h2>
<p><a name="multi-core"></a> The Win32 distribution of SABnzbd now comes with a multi-core version of the PAR2 program which will see improvements for those with multi-core processors. For Linux you will need to locate the multi-core versions of par2 yourself, such <a href="https://forums.sabnzbd.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=18793#p99702">as described here</a>.<br>
    The behaviour of multi-core PAR2 can be influenced by an extra parameter.
    This option is only of use to users running the multi-core par2 version, so do not specify the value if you are running the normal (single-core) version of par2.<br>
    These are the choices:
</p>
<p><code>-t-</code> Use it single-core<br>
    <code>-t0</code> Use multi-core for repairs but not for verify (prevents disk trashing)<br>
    <code>-t+</code> Always use multi-core<br>

    You may need to experiment a bit to get the best behaviour for your system.
</p>
<p>Should you have another variant of PAR2, you specify its required parameters here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if your system has problems with this program, you can force the use of the classic version by unchecking "Enable MultiCore Par2"</p>

<h2 id="par2cmdline">Par2cmdline</h2>
<p>On many Linux distributions, par2cmdline is used to repair jobs. However, in version 0.6.13 a 'feature' was introduced that causes less blocks to be found. In order to restore optimal behavior, users of par2cmdline should add to <strong>Extra PAR2 parameters</strong>:
<p><code>-N</code> Extend the search for missing blocks (par2cmdline 0.6+, explanation <a href="https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline/issues/65">see here</a>)<br>

<h2 id="toc8"><span>Nice to reduce CPU priority</span></h2>
<p><a name="nice"></a> When SABnzbd runs external tools like <strong>par2</strong> and <strong>unrar</strong>, these tools may use up all CPU capacity.
    If you set parameters in the <strong>nice</strong> option box, the tool will be used (if installed).
    You will need to experiment with the parameters. Leaving the box empty will disable the use of <strong>nice</strong>.<br>
    Popular parameters are <code>-n10</code>.<br>
    For more info, see the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/nice" target="_blank">nice man-page</a>

<h2 id="toc9"><span>IONice to reduce disk priority</span></h2>
<p><a name="ionice"></a> When SABnzbd runs external tools like <strong>par2</strong> and <strong>unrar</strong>, these tools may use up all disk capacity
    This can make simultaneous use of the system problematic, e.g. when you want to watch a movie.
    If you set parameters in the <strong>ionice</strong> option box, the tool will be used (if installed).
    You will need to experiment with the parameters. Leaving the box empty will disable the use of <strong>ionice</strong>.<br>
    Popular parameters are <code>-c2 -n4</code>.<br>
    For more info, see the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice" target="_blank">ionice man-page</a>

<p>Be careful, using wrong parameters will make all external tools fail!</p>
