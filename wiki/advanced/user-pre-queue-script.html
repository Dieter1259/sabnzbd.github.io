title: Use pre-queue script
---
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p>You can choose to let SABnzbd run a script just before an NZB enters the queue.<br>
    This script will tell whether the NZB should be accepted or not and can modify some parameters.
</p>
<p>There will be a single script only, to be set in Config-&gt;Switches (picked from the general script folder).<br>
    The sorting info is passed independent on the actual Sorting settings.<br>
    Only the SeasonSort method will be used for analysis.
</p>
<p>The script can be anything that is considered "executable" by the operating system.<br>
    So on Windows is most likely a CMD or BAT file.<br>
    On Linux is might be a shell script; make sure you set the X bit.
</p>
<p>The script must send results to the console.<br>
    Exit code 0 will make SABnzbd inspect the returned output.<br>
    If the script has an exit code other than 0, it's assumed the script failed, and the NZB will be accepted without changes.
</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Input parameters</span></h3>
<p>All parameters (except 1) can be empty, meaning a default value.<br></p>

<p>Take note that on Windows, each parameter that contains a space will be embedded in quotes: "this example".<br>
    Season and episode are numerical strings, without leading 0.
</p>
<p>The script can refuse or accept the NZB and it can also return alternative parameters.<br>
    When you want to manipulate the season parameters, you should assemble a new name and return a recognized format.
</p>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Return parameters</span></h3>
<p>The script writes the results to the console, each parameter on a separate line.<br>

<p>SABnzbd uses the first 7 lines of output, so they should only contain proper data (or be empty).<br>
    Anything after line 7 is ignored.
