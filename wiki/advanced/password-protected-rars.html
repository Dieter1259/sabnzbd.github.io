title: Password-protected RARs
---
<p>Sometimes you encounter encrypted (or password-protected) RARs. It's only useful to download a password protected post when you know the password upfront. Trying to get a password afterwards is probably a waste of your time and/or money.</p>
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Pause</span></h3>
<p>There's <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches">an option</a> that will pause a job as soon as the first encrypted RAR file has been downloaded.<br>
    You can choose to delete the job or resume it.
</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Password per NZB</span></h3>
<p>Supposing you know the required password, you can give it to SABnzbd before the download starts post-processing.<br>
    You can do this in two ways:
</p>
<p>In the NZB file name you can embed the password like this: {% raw %}<code>My Job {{PW}}.nzb</code>{% endraw %} or <code>My Job password=PW.nzb</code><br>
    This will set the the job name to "My Job" and the password to "PW".
</p>
<p>You can rename the job in the queue.<br>
    <code>My Job / PASSWORD</code> will set the password. The '/' is used as a separator because it cannot be part of a folder name.<br>
    The folder name will be "My Job" and "PASSWORD" will be used as the decryption password when unpacking.
</p>
<p>The password can be changed until the job enters the post-processing queue.</p>

<h3>Inside the NZB</h3>
<p>Indexers and NZB suppliers can include the password inside the NZB <code>head</code> section (see <a href="/wiki/extra/nzb-spec">NZB specification</a>):</p>
{% highlight html %}
<meta type="password">secret</meta>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Or as the <code>x-dnzb-password</code> header when SABnzbd fetches the URL.


<h3 id="toc2"><span>Password file</span></h3>
<p>If you don't set a password per job, you can create a text file containing all passwords to be tried.<br>
    It's a simple ASCII text file (created with Notepad, VI or TextEdit) and should contain one password per line.<br>
    Please note that having a large number of passwords will make unpacking very slow.<br>
    Specify where the file is in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/folders">Config-&gt;Folders</a>.
</p>
