title: User Scripts
---
<p>SABnzbd can run a user-provided script to be executed when a job has completed without errors.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you like with such a script.</p>
<p>The script will receive the parameters described below. Use %1 in Windows scripts and $1 in Unix scripts.</p>
<p>Please note that in Windows the parameters will be enclosed in double quotes ("my name").<br>
    On Posix systems (OSX, Linux, Unix) the parameters will <strong>not</strong> have quotes at all.
</p>

            <td>1</td>

            <td>URL to be called when job failed (if provided by the server, it is always sent, so check parameter 7!) The URL is provided by some indexers as the X-DNZB-Failure header.<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></td>

<p>All parameters are properly quoted so that they may contain embedded spaces.</p>
<p>The "return" code that your script itself returns should be 0 if all went well or non-zero if errors occurred. If the return code is something else than 0, SABnzbd's History will show that return code (also known as exit code) in green surrounded by "Exit(â€¦)".</p>
<p>The console output of the script is captured by SABnzbd and is saved in the so called "Script Log": to see that log, in the History overview, click on the "More" after the <strong>green</strong> text on the right hand side .<br>
    The file will be added to the (optional) notification email and can be examined in the History page.
</p>
<p>A post-processing script will only run when the job has completed without errors.<br>
    If you want to run the script always, you need to disable the option <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/switches">"Post-Process Only Verified Jobs"</a>.
</p>
<p>A script can return an exit code. SABnzbd will show a non-zero code in the download report, but the job will not be flagged as failed.<br>
    Note: Release 0.8.0 has an option in <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/switches">Config-&gt;Switches</a> to let a non-zero code mark the job as failed.
</p>
<p>All scripts must be located in the script-directory, that can be specified in <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/folders">Config-&gt;Directories</a>. Furthermore, the script must be executable. On Linux this means the x-bit must be on. On Windows, the requirement is that the script's extension is listed in your system's PATHEXT environment variable.</p>
<p>The scripts can be used in these contexts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Associated with a job entry on the Main page</li>
    <li>Changed for a job on the Queue page</li>
    <li>Associated with a <a href="/wiki/configuration/1.0/categories">user-defined category</a></li>
    <li>Associated with the empty-queue event on the Queue page</li>
</ul>

<p>The get the parameters in python, you can do this:</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>import sys

        directory = sys.argv[1]

        print "No commandline parameters found"
        sys.exit(1)
