title: SABnzbd as a Windows Service
---
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Service management</span></h1>
<p>It's possible to install SABnzbd as a real Windows Service. The Windows executable is <code>SABnzbd-service.exe</code>, the other EXE files do not have service support.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> You need administrative rights when you make any change to the services, although SABnzbd itself will run fine when in restricted user mode.
</p>
<p>For the meaning of the various options required during service installation, see <a href="/wiki/advanced/command-line-parameters">Command Line Parameters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Installing the service</span></h2>
<p><pre><code>SABnzbd-service.exe -f &lt;path-to-ini&gt; install</code></pre></p>
<p>The <code>-f</code> parameter is required. When running as a service, SABnzbd will be in "daemon" mode and will not get the INI-file location from the user profile.<br>
    You can add extra parameters, but any parameter you set here will block you from making changes to those parameters in the configuration through the Web-UI.<br>
    So, if you use <code>-s host:port</code>, SABnzbd will always use that as server address, disregarding what's in the INI file.<br>
    Parameters like <code>-b</code> (start browser) will be ignored.
</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Updating the service</span></h2>
<p><pre><code>SABnzbd-service.exe -f &lt;path-to-ini&gt; update</code></pre></p>
<p>Works the same as "install", but should be used to change settings.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Removing the service</span></h2>
<p><pre><code>SABnzbd-service.exe remove</code></pre></p>
<p>Removes the service altogether.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Start and Stop</span></h2>
<p><pre><code>net start SABnzbd
net stop SABnzbnd
net stop SABHelper</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Use the Windows Service Manager to start and stop (command line or GUI). It's probably best to start in <code>Automatic</code> mode. On Windows 7 and higher you can best use <code>Automatic (delayed)</code>.<br>
    <span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> SABHelper must be stopped separately, <em>after</em> SABnzbd is stopped.<br>
    <span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> You <strong>must</strong> have installed the SABHelper service first (see below), otherwise SABnzbd will not start.<br>
    When installed, the SABHelper service will be started when the SABnzbd service starts.
</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Helper Service</span></h1>
<p>Because a Windows Service cannot restart itself, we created the SABHelper service.
    It is controlled in the same way as <code>SABnzbd-service.exe</code>, only it needs no additional parameters.<br>
    The service SABHelper will be created automatically when installing the service.<br>
    <span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> This service (unlike SABnzbd) needs to be run as "Local System" or as another account with administrative privileges.
</p>
<p><pre><code>SABnzbd-helper.exe install
SABnzbd-helper.exe remove
SABnzbd-helper.exe update
SABnzbd-helper.exe start
SABnzbd-helper.exe stop</code></pre>
</p>
<h1 id="toc6"><span>Restrictions</span></h1>
<p>Running as a service does pose some restrictions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The SABHelper Service <strong>must</strong> run as "Local System" or any account that has administrative privileges.</li>
    <li>By default the service runs as "Local System". This allows full access to the internal harddisk, but <strong>not</strong> to network shares.</li>
    <li>If you need network shares, you should tell the Service Manager to use an appropriate user account.</li>
    <li>When using network shares, you must use network (UNC) paths (<code>\\server\share</code>) instead of drive letters (<code>P:\</code>).</li>
    <li>Use only local drives for the admin, log and incomplete folders (par2 does not support UNC)</li>
    <li>The Windows firewall will not warn you that it blocks <code>SABnzbd-service.exe</code>, you will have to add it to the exception list yourself.</li>
    <li>You can upgrade SABnzbd without changing the service registrations, but you do need to stop both services first</li>
    <li>Upgrading without changing service registration only works when you install at the same location</li>
    <li>The Tray-menu (0.7.0+) will not be shown (a Service cannot do this)</li>
</ul>
