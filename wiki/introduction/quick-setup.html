<h1 id="toc4"><span>Installing SABnzbd</span></h1>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Windows</span></h2>
<p>Run the installer, follow the prompts. When prompted for installation options, decide if you want SABnzbd to launch in the background when you log in, if you want it to be associated with <code>.nzb</code> files, and if you want a desktop icon created.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>macOS</span></h2>
<p>Double-click the <code>.dmg</code>, drag the <code>.app</code> to Applications. You're done!</p>
<h2 id="toc7"><span>Ubuntu Linux</span></h2>
<p>You already installed it via apt. After installing, edit <code>/etc/default/sabnzbdplus</code> if you want SABnzbd to run at startup.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="toc8"><span>Upgrading SABnzbd</span></h1>
<p>For all operating systems, to upgrade SABnzbd simply shut down SABnzbd and re-install. In it's a major release (Eg: from 0.7.20 to 1.1.0), it's always better to first finish the queue before updating.</p>

<h1 id="toc9"><span>The Wizard</span></h1>
<p>On all operating systems, on first-launch of SABnzbd you'll be presented with our quick-start wizard, which will hopefully get you up and running as soon as possible. Here's a quick walk through the steps of the wizard. All settings in the wizard can be changed later on under the various Configuration pages.</p>

<h2 id="toc13"><span>Server Setup</span></h2>
<p>On this page, enter the server information provided by your news host. If you are using SSL, be sure to tick the SSL checkbox. Once you've entered your server details, click the "Test Server" button to determine if the connection works.</p>

<h2 id="toc15"><span>Restart</span></h2>
<p>You've reached the end of the wizard! Once you've reached this page, SABnzbd will automatically restart. Please wait for it to finish. After a few seconds you'll be presented with a link to <code>http://localhost:8080/sabnzbd</code>. You should bookmark this link, as it's how you'll access SABnzbd in the future.</p>
